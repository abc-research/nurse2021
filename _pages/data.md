The accelerometer data has been collected using one smartphone carried by subjects, which are caregivers and nurses, when they were conducting daily works at a healthcare facility. The smartphone was carried in an arbitrary position such as a pocket. There are a total of 27 activities divided into 4 groups. All the activities are listed in the below table.

## Data structure
In this challenge, participants are provided training data and test data. Training data contains accelerometer data from 12 subjects (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, and 22) and the activity labels file, which was collected in May and June 2018 (before June 18). Test data contains the data of 12 subjects (same id with the train data), which was collected in June 2018 (at 18 and afterward).

The provided training data folder includes the accelerometer data files of 12 subjects and the “label” folder, which contains “label_train.csv".

In each accelerometer data file, we have 4 columns: datetime and 3 coordinates of the accelerometer data.

![data-acc](/nurse2021/assets/data-acc.png)


In the label file (“label.csv”), we have 12 columns: id (label id), user_id, role, activity_type_id, activity_type (name in japanese), activity_type_e (name in english), date, start time, finish time (of the activity), target_id (patients), target_role, activity2user_id.
Participants should note that the start and finish time at the label_train file may differ from the datetime at the accelerometer file due to the different time zone.
